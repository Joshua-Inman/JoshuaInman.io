			<h1 id="test">Welcome To My Website</h1>
			<p>Hello everyone visiting, I just uploaded my Html and Css files to my new domain and web host from my GoDaddy account. This website will be a work in progress as I learn more about web development. I’m not exactly sure what I really want to create with this website so expect constant tinkering. I have also inserted some temporary <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank">Lorem Ipsum</a> text below just so my website isn't completely empty for the time being. Depending on the time you are reading this it may or may not still be there, thanks for reading.</p>

			<h2>Website Progression</h2>
			<p>I’ve been working on my website for a couple days now and have finally decided it's time to start adding some actual content. Like I mentioned initially I’m still not exactly sure what I want this website to be once it's finished. So for the time being I’m just going to utilize it as a Blog styled website and build around that. You know what, let’s just go ahead and call these “Developer Updates”. That sounds much more suiting. It’s currently 7:10 PM at night as of the time I’m writing this and there's only three more days until Fourth of July. My Uncle Tom and Aunt Jenny along with my Cousin’s Evan and Max will be arriving sometime by tomorrow night. We plan on spending the Fourth together in Peachtree City then the following day driving down to Florida to go to Disney World.</p>
			<p>I’ll keep these “Developer Update” posts in balance of each other between where I’m currently at in life and my thought processes as I go about developing this website. I will try to keep them as short and as equally interesting as I can. Thanks for reading.</p>

			<h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
			<p>It’s been quite awhile since I have added any content to this website. Between visiting friends and family the past two weeks I haven't had the time to sit down and mess about with the creation of this website that I had when I first started. When I do find a moment whether that is long car rides or when everyone is sleeping, I have been learning a lot more about Javascript.</p>
			<p>I’ve come to the decision that I am going to temporarily put that on hold and re-design the current website. The website I built a couple weeks ago has served its purpose, allowing myself to get my feet through the door and actually experience having a live website online for anyone to view. I have a general idea of what I want it to look like in my head but I’m sure that will change as I go. After I create the desired look for the website I plan on making a routined developer update/blog post schedule, and continue learning more JavaScript.</p>
			<p>Beyond my web development I also have a lot of other plans and goals. Some of the major ones such as going back to the gym and reading an entire book from start to finnish. I typically go to the gym or do some form of exercise at least three times a week, although I haven't really done much of any since I was in the hospital. So hopefully by the next content post I will have gotten back into my ordinary routine.</p>
			<p>Every time I sit down to write these I’ve noticed they tend to become longer and longer. I guess you can consider that good right? Thanks for reading.</p>

			<h2>Redesign Thoughts</h2>
			<p>In the last developer update I made it apparent that I was going to completely redesign the current website. Shortly after I started constructing the new layout and looking at various references online and it came to my mind that this wasn’t what I wanted. I couldn't make up my mind and it was starting to feel overwhelming just scrapping all my hard work and completely starting over. With this in mind I decided to just build off of what I already had rather than starting from the ground up again. It was certainly a lot less work and in the end I achieved a result that I quite enjoy.</p>
			<p>Once I finished most of the redesigning aspect I had intended originally, I began tinkering with other projects like converting floats to flex and some media queries. I didn’t end up finishing most of those but this version was becoming extensive enough so I decided to upload it with the current changes that I had done already.</p>
			<p>I also started reading a book which is good, still no gym unfortunately. Although I haven't tackled all my goals currently I plan on doing so tomorrow which is monday, a fresh start to a new week. I haven’t been working at my job as recently than I normally would so this should give me no excuses to reach these short term goals. I’m always engrossed by one thing or subject never concerned by the other during that time period. So at times I myself can make things particularly difficult when they don't need to be, although i'm learning to break that bad habit. Thanks for reading.</p>

			<h2>Achieving Short Term Goals</h2>
			<p>It’s 11:35 p.m. at night and I have work early in the morning. I decided to go ahead and sit down at my computer desk for a couple minutes and write a bit. Recently I talked about some of the goals that I had set up for myself to reach in the near future and that got me thinking. A lot of the time I tend to focus on the big picture of things and almost dismiss everything else. I know that can sound sort of strange and illogical but hopefully you understand what I’m trying to convey here. Anyway, my point is I’ve sort of stopped and noticed how important having short term goals can really be.</p>
			<p>For instance, I said I wanted to read a book and start going back to the gym. Although I haven’t gone back to the gym or read an entire book yet, I have steadily begun them. I started doing simple exercises in my house again like pushups and pullups. I also have read a couple chapters in my book throughout the past week. On top of that I even took a short six hour JavaScript class at General Assembly. Sidenote, while I was there I ate at Brezza Cucina Pizzeria for lunch and it was delicious, definitely would recommend it.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, this isn't really any groundbreaking news or advice to anyone but I wanted to share it nevertheless. If there's one thing I really dislike that is being rushed. So when I stepped back and thought about this idea for a moment it was sort of an epiphany for myself. I’m simply rushing my own self, in a bad way of course. Sometimes you just need to merely slow down and focus a little. By acknowledging that I’ve accomplished what most people on this earth don’t do that they should; which is to focus reflecting on yourself rather than people or things around you.</p>
			<p>Sorry for the lengthy lecture but as I mentioned earlier it was on my mind so I wanted to go ahead and discuss it. Hopefully by the next update I’ll have some developer topics to touch up on, thanks for reading.</p>

			<h2>Minor Improvements</h2>
			<p>I just released the most current version 0.1.9 of my website. Not much was changed or added this update but the minor things that did certainly make a much more neater and presentable difference. Lately i’ve been all over the place jumping between various topics and subjects regarding web development. Some days I’ll learn about some Javascript while others I might learn about some Css. There's really no rhyme or reason to it exactly. It’s just whatever I end up finding online that interest me or has answers to a particular question I may have. Eventually, I would like to start learning about Php but I’m not exactly sure when I’ll realistically dive into that.</p>
			<p>As of right now I’m sort of just going with the flow of things, learning little snippets here and there as I go. It usually doesn’t take long for one thought or idea of mine to snowball into a rather large craving for more knowledge and information. I feel like I have learned a lot for the short amount of time I have been developing this website but it’s not enough to satisfy myself.</p>
			<p>There isn’t all that much I can really think of to talk about off the top of my head without getting into much detail. Which is what I would like to try and stay away from with these developer updates of course. I just wanted to make sure I got at least a little bit of content out for anyone who is interested. Sometimes I can sit down and write away while other times not so much. Hopefully you can forgive me for this lackluster content but like I mentioned at least it's something rather than nothing, thanks for reading.</p>

			<h2>A Productive Month</h2>
			<p>Tomorrow will be a one day and one month since I have written a developer update. Although I haven't been active with my personal website that's not to say I haven't been coding or learning during my absence. This past month has actually been one of the most exciting and knowledge fulfilling in a while.</p>
			<p>Near the beginning of August I started working on a group project with a friend I had met named Zach. Prior to the collaboration Zach and I didn’t really talk all that much but he was always there to help me when I had a code related issue. As you could imagine this was quite nice being that if I ever had an issue my mentor was Google and basically still is I guess. He sprung the idea to my attention to make a website for my Discord server. This was a perfect opportunity for the both of us. Finally I could get my hands dirty and work on a project rather than just sitting down and reading how code functions on paper. Not to mention I now have a new friend that will help and guide me along the way. Immediately that night we began creating the landing page for <a href="https://thegaminglounge.github.io./" target="_blank">The Gaming Lounge</a> Discord server.</p>
			<p>During this entire month I learned a lot of things. There are far too many to actually write down that anyone would care to read but to highlight it would look something like this. Of course in no particular order some of the major fundamentals I learned this month are: Git, Github, Bootstrap, PhP, more Javascript and a little bit of jQuery. I didn’t really think about it that much until I actually sat down to write this but I have taken in quite a large amount of new information recently. Not to mention on top of all of those I also developed the new website and worked on my original website a little bit.</p>
			<p>Depending on the time you are reading this the Discord server website isn’t actually complete yet but hopefully by the next update it will. As to what I will learn next I’m not really sure. Like I mentioned before it doesn’t take much for myself to turn into a growing snowball rapidly rolling down a hill when it comes to code. I also have been trying to achieve Diamond back in League of Legends but this update has already been long enough, thanks for reading.</p>
